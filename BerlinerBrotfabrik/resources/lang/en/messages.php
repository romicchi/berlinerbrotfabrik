    // OUR STORY DESCRIPTION
    'Our Story Description' => 'It was in 2004 when the founder and sole managing director of a German group of companies operating across Europe, Harald Fuechsel, was asked by Germany\'s Senior Expert Service to make his many years of experience available to a university in Indonesia.
    <br> <br> Being able to help as a Senior Expert in Indonesia was very appealing to him, which is why he immediately agreed.
    <br> <br> His two university degrees as a mechanical engineer, including food technology, and even business law were an advantage.
    <br> <br> However, a specialist translator was necessary so that lectures for students and teachers could be translated simultaneously from English into Bahasa Indonesia.
    <br> <br> The graduate of a university in Bandung, Mr. RD Hena Mulianakusumah, who specializes in foreign languages, was recruited for this task.
    <br> <br> In the years that followed, a very close collaboration developed between the two men, which resulted in various projects.',
    
    'Our Story Description More' => '<br> <br> As a result, a joint company was founded that focused on supporting SMEs and start-ups.
    <br> <br> This is how the idea of developing and later opening a German bakery and pastry in Tasikmalaya, the “Berliner Brotfabrik” came about.
    <br> <br> However, RD. Hena Mulianakusumah needed additional studies and education so that he could manage the new company.
    <br> <br> In addition to the German language, he also studied in Germany “SME development and establishing start-up companies”.
    <br> <br> He also learned at the First German Bakery Academy in Olpe and completed internships lasting several months in the town of Frechen, near Cologne, and in Dresden.
    <br> <br> Two members of the bakery team from Tasikmalaya also completed internships in Germany.
    <br> <br> The team training in Tasikmalaya was supplemented by the deployment of experts from Germany over several months, including the long-standing bakery boss of the Cologne Chamber of Crafts, master baker Claus Gerhard, the Dresden master baker and confectioner Wolfgang Gradel and the master baker Sebastian Pietsch.
    <br> <br> The painter and graphic artist Hans-Jörg Waskowski, who designed the logo of the “Berliner Brotfabrik” and developed a whole range of design elements for the premises of the German Bakery and Pastry, also played a significant part.
    <br> <br> With the “Berliner Brotfabrik” own building on Jalan Gunung Sari No. 25, which was newly opened in the year 2018 in the style of a German half-timbered building from the 17th century, friendly rooms were created for production, sales, cafés and meetings.
    <br> <br> The “Berliner Brotfabrik” celebrated its 10th anniversary in 2024.

    <br> <br> A special thank you goes to our loyal customers!',

    'Who We Are Description More' => '<br> <br> We are also very calorie-conscious in our production and only use good fats and reduce sugar or sugary ingredients in our baked goods.
